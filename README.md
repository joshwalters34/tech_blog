# tech_blog
This applicatiion is a forum for users to post tech related blogs.  These site will be a location for user to post their own blogs, read blog postings from other users, and comment on these posts..   

## Motivation
My motivation for this site is to create a single place were a user can go to get tech related information.  There are so many sites on the web that supply data, so I wanted to create one place where a user can interact with their peers and get valuable, tech-related information.
